# We are telling it we need the official "github" tool.

# Part 2: Configure the tool.
# We leave this empty. When running in GitHub Actions, it will
# automatically and securely authenticate for us.

# Part 3: Define our resource blueprint.
# This is the "Infrastructure as Code" part. We are describing
# a GitHub Label that we want to exist.
